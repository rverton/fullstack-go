# Fullstack Go - Template

This is a template for a fullstack Go web application. I'm using this
for my own projects.

- [echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) for web routing capabilities
- [templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ) as a template engine
- [sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx) for database access
- Tailwind for styling
- Make for commands
